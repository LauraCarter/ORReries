# Welcome to ORReries
ORReries works with researchers to create and share understanding of what it means to research in a reflexive and feminist way, and to build tools for researchers to develop these skills, teach others, and advocate for feminist reflexive research practices in their communities.

Researchers who want to make their research feminist and reflexive can use ORReries to find resources to help them and to communicate and connect with other researchers. 
They can also contribute to ORReries to help other researchers.

## What is ORR?
ORR stands for Open Reflexive Research.

**Open**: these materials and this community are built on open principles. 
Mozilla defines [open working](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/) as a way of working in which "_everyone_ is invited to collaborate on something amazing, and any new product or knowledge is shared widely and freely."

**Reflexive**: paying attention to how research and researchers shape each other and how they are influenced by - and influence - their contexts.

**Research**: broadly defined - any work that aims to find something out!

## What is an orrery?
[Orreries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery) are models of the Solar System. 
They are tools which helped early astronomers make sense of the ways that celestial bodies moved.
As well as being clever pieces of engineering, they are often beautifully designed.
Orreries don't capture everything we know about how the universe works: but they are a good place to start and help us go further in our work.
